CRUD method: Create, Read, Update, Delete

Boise CodeWorks sandbox API: https://bcw-sandbox.herokuapp.com/

step 1: build out a controller;
Make export class/ constructor.
Console log to make sure your controller is connected properly.
Then create an async inside of the class (i.e. async getCars(){})
Make sure to call the async in the controller.

Step 2: create a service;
create service class, then export it on the bottom of the service page.
inside your class, use const response = await api.get()
Then log every response you get.

Step 3: Make a Model;
use export class Name{
  constructor (data){
    this.____ = data._____
  }
}
