# Managing the Fullstack Application

1. Describe the two ways to bind Data in Vue?

  > | : this is  way to bind data, as is V-bind I think.

2. The `SPA` acronym stands for what?

  > | Single Page Application

3. What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?

  > | I think with bigger applications, single page allows for a more responsive application. 

4. What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?

  > | Anything located inside an onMounted will run as that page is loaded for the user.

5. What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?

  > | Allows us to take input from the user and make an object out of it like when a user fills out a form.

6. What is the package.json file used for?

  > | It is used to load any dependencies needed for the project or frameworks to work properly.

7. Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?

  > | V-if and V-show can be used, v-if renders an element if all conditions are met. V-show will only render is all conditions are met and will hide the element with a display none if they are not met.

8. What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?

  > | the key is how a v-for iterates through things and a unique key helps make sure that the correct items are iterated through.

9. What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?

  > | It allows us to insert information into component areas that we save with the slot. It makes it so we don't have to build out lots of components for the same thing like how we used it in class to change the information a from was collecting or needing to collect.
