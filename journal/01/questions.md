# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | To publish and share code, Git also uses a version control which allows developers to revert to previous versions of repositories. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | make a directory in the command line|

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > it's used to highlight something on your page, such as a hyperlink or a button turning a different shade when you hover over it.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > It helps determine what rules to follow if there are more than one being used to target an element on the page, the one with the higher specificity will always be run and displayed on the page. This can be useful when one of the selectors in your code could be one of the first to run but if it's specificity is high enough it could remain as what is displayed on screen.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > If you have to many !important in your code they could start to overrule each other and mess up the specificity of the elements on your page.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > The Selector, property, and the value

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > |A website with an attractive or exciting design can help keep the customer browsing for more products as well as create excitement in purchasing a product or service from the website.|

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > To have an outline while creating a webpage so it can stay more user focused and it helps the developer know how a user is intended to interact with the page and they are easy and chape to make.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Yes i think they are extremely useful because they help the developer have a clear thought process but seeing what it is they are trying to achieve for themselves or for a client instead of try to make it up as they build it.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > It allows the developer to design the layout of a page easier by making the sections of the page be able to move along the x and y axis easier than possible while using CSS.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > Margin and padding affect the box model
