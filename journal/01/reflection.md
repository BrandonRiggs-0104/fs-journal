# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

I have learned a lot about styling a webpage this week, CSS has a lot of useful tools to help design a page but something I did't even know about is bootstrap. So far I have a love hate relationship with bootstrap, one second I love it more than CSS and other times I wish I was only using CSS. I do think they can compliment each other well when in comes to building a page.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think most things went well this week, I was honestly shocked at how fun and challenging it could be to recreate a website.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Bootstrap for sure was a good and evil surprise, its super useful but not always the most friendly for people just starting out.
- What are you struggling with?
I am definitely struggling with taking a great looking page made with bootstrap and getting it to look just as good or even decent on a mobile application.
- What would you count as a victory?
Being able create a website from a wireframe is a good accomplishment but I would count the biggest victory this week to be, actually learning to get a desktop sight to work on a mobile platform successfully and I haven't fully got it down yet but with enough messing around with it i think i can get a sight to look decent.
