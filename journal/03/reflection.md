# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I would say the partner programming, that has continued to help me a lot in learning and preparing for the checkpoint every week. Without it I don't think I would do well or get very far on the checkpoint at all.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Honestly id say the whole concept of mvc kind of shocked me because I do understand it's usefulness and how it can be a valuable asset in the industry I was just shocked at how it felt like the course took you from learning to walk while coding to learning to run blindfolded while coding.

- What are you struggling with?
I'd say the part I still have some struggle with is just having a blank controller,service,and model. Once I get things on the page and the code starts to work I start to feel more confident but the blank pages just mke me stop and wonder where im suppose to start sometimes.

- What would you count as a victory?
I would count being able to get through the week and be able to actually learn from and assist my partner during the paired programming lab on thursday is a victory because when i left the school monday after seeing mvc for the first time I never thought i'd be able to grasp the concept.
