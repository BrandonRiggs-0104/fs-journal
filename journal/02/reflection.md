# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I would say the week was okay overall, but I think what went best was the partner programming with the boss fight, it was really helpful to be partnered with someone to bounce ideas off and get a different input from. I also liked it because being partnered with someone means I had to slow down and learn to communicate code.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
first of all that little question mark (?) has a name, i think it was elvis something but I got those a lot earlier in the week and didn't understand what it was trying to show me, other than that I would say I was surprised that you can use .forEach like a for loop.

- What are you struggling with?
I was definitely struggling a lot with draw functions and im still not the greatest at them but I have definitely seen some improvements.

- What would you count as a victory?
being able to successfully complete the boss fight lab and actually learn a lot from it about functions and drawing to the website from console which I struggled with a lot.
