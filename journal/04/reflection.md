# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Uh not much, I was at least able to pull off of an API and draw it to the screen!

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
That people really make massive API's for fun but NO ONE makes them in a similar format.

- What are you struggling with?
Being able to push the data from one API into another and I still have some trouble drawing to the screen.

- What would you count as a victory?
I've made it through the week and have a VERY basic understanding of how API's work.
