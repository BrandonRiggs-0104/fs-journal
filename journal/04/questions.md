# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | asynchronous is non-blocking so each task isn't dependent on another to run while synchronous code does require the code before it to be ran before it can be executed.

02. What is an event listener?

  > | is a procedure that waits for an event to happen like a user clicking something on the page.

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | Representational State Transfer, which means that when a request is made the server will transfer a representation of the state of the requested source.

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | A callback passes an argument on to another function while a higher order takes a function and passes it as an input or output.

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise is for when a value isn't known and it can be used in the try/catch method. If the functions under try are unsuccessful the catch will display an error.

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | Get, Post, Put

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application programming Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | It must be in an async function.

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | Restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot access state values

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | code 200

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | the server cannot process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error
